        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project, we implemented some basic image rendering and modfication algorithms, including rasterization,
        basic antialiasing, and texture mapping. It was amazing seeing how just a few simple equations and rules could translate
        to such convincing image alterations, and definitely rewarding to see the correct output. Debugging was also slightly 
        different from typical programming assignments -- translating the visual output from the code required really understanding 
        how the computer encodes color.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

        <p>
            In this task, we implemented triangle rasterization, or determined which pixels should be colored-in to best represent the triangle.
            Since the edges that compose the triangle are continuous, but we only have discrete points that we can color, these boundaries will not be perfect.
        </p>

        <p>
            We first confined our search to a box just large enough to fit our entire triangle. This was done by finding the largest and smallest x
            and y values of our triangle's vertices and iterating through each of the points within the bounds (min_x, max_x) and (min_y, max_y). For each  pixel,
            we then found where it was located in relation to the edge (i.e. inside the triangle, outside the triangle, or on the edge itself). This was
            determined using the equation L_i(x, y) = (x - X_i)dY + y - Y_i)dX_i, where an output greater than or equal to zero meant that the point was inside
            the triangle or on its edge. We added an offset of +0.5 for the x and y-values of each pixel so that the middle of each pixel was used, giving
            us the most accurate triangle given the resolution. These points were colored using the provided helper method fill_pixel.
            Our algorithm is not worse than the one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, but it does perform exactly the same
            as one that does since that is precisely the algorithm we used.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
        
        <p>
            Supersampling is a useful antialiasing method that reduces the appearance of jaggies and other aliasing artifacts. In other words, 
            jagged edges will appear smoother, and discontinuities within narrow shapes will be remedied.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were several modifications that had to be made to the rasterization done in pt 1 to support supersampling. 
            First, the sampling buffer is scaled by the sampling rate. For example, if the screen size is 100px and the sampling rate is 9, 
            then the sampling buffer size is 900px. The RGB frame buffer stays the same, at (screen size) x 3, where the 3 represents the 
            number of color channels. During rasterization itself, an additional nested for loop was added within the screen pixel iteration, 
            and this loop iterates through the subsamples per pixel and populates the sample buffer. In the final step of the process, the RGB 
            frame buffer is populated. This is accomplished by looping over the samples in the sample buffer, and, for each pixel, finding the 
            average value of the samples. This average is then stored in the frame buffer via the RGB channels.

            Above, we see triangle rasterization with supersampling performed at a sampling rate of 1, 4, and 16 (in order from left to
            right). At a sampling rate of 1, we see discontinuities, as we are sampling just once per pixel, and some (but not all) of
            the pixel centers lie within the bounds of the triangle. Since the shading is binary – either the pixel is fully colored 
            or fully uncolored – we see discontinuities in narrow regions of shading. At a sampling rate of 4 times per pixel, we begin 
            to see some antialiasing, where the pixels begin to take on the average color of the 4 samples. Some breaks in the shape are
            still seen, but the resulting image is still smoother than when sampled once per pixel. When 16 samples are taken per pixel,
            the triangle corner is even more evident, and no discontinuities are seen.

            Cubeman is remembering how he danced during middle school in the 80s. He said that the colors were a trend at a time, we’re 
            not quite sure what to believe.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

        <p>Barycentric coordinates are coordinates within a shape that shows relatively how far the point is from all the vertices of 
        the shape. In the following image colors are representative of the distance from a particular vertex. Each vertex is assigned to 
        a color and when a point is close to that vertex the color of that point is mostly the color of the vertex, as points move away 
        from that vertex it slowly fades as it blends into the color of other vertices.</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

        <p>
            Pixel sampling describes the process of mapping the pixels from an image onto a texture. For this part of the project, we 
            used two different pixel sampling methods: bilinear and nearest sampling. Nearest sampling, in contrast, relies on the 
            color of the texel that is closest to (or nearest to) the center of the pixel. Bilinear sampling, in contrast, is done 
            by finding the four nearest texels and calculating the weighted average, where each weight corresponds to the distance 
            between a texel and the point.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For nearest sampling, this was accomplished by finding the nearest texel and using that one’s color. For bilinear 
            interpolation, the four nearest texels were found. Two linear interpolations were used (two texels in each linear 
            interpolation), and a final lerp was used to combine the outputs of the previous two lerps. The color obtained from 
            this final operation was used to fill in the pixel.
        </p>

        <p>
            Generally, bilinear sampling will result in a better gradient. Nearest sampling, since it uses one rather than 4 texels, 
            will use far less computational power but result in a blockier texture mapping. There will be a large difference between 
            the two methods when mapping onto textures with more warping / deviation from the original image.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This difference is demonstrated in East Asia and the latitude and longitude lines on the world map.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

        <p>
            Level sampling is sampling based on levels of mipmaps, at each level, the high frequencies are filtered out then the whole
            texture map is downsampled (by a factor log2 at each increasing level).
        </P>
        <p>
            To implement level sampling, first the barycentric coordinates of (x,y), (x+1,y), and (x, y+1) are calculated, this is the 
            distance between two pixels on the screen. Then the distances between pixels are calculated for the texture map. Then 
            depending how far the texels are from its neighboring texel, the approximate mipmap level is calculated. The longer the 
            distance between the texels the higher level of mipmap is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            For level sampling, linear sampling takes more time than nearest. For nearest the entire image texture is calculated by 
            accessing the same level of mipmap. In comparison linear needs extra time to calculate the weighted sum between two mipmap 
            levels for every pixel. Though linear interpolation has stronger antialiasing power, and the final image has fewer jaggies 
            than the one done using nearest mipmap level. Similarly, nearest pixel sampling is less costly in terms of memory usage, and 
            it is faster than bilinear sampling. Bilinear creates a smoother image because its weighted sum lowers the frequency. Increasing 
            the number of samples per pixel increases antialiasing power at the cost of memory and slower speed. From 1 sample to 4 samples 
            per pixel we need memory and time to store and average 4 samples. Which is always higher than a lower sample rate.

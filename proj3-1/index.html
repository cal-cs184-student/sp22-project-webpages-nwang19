<h1 align="middle">Assignment 3: PathTracer</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Nicole Wang, Angela Gao</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this assignment, we implemented basic lighting and speeding up algorithms used in computer graphics.</p>
        <o>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
            <p>
                We started the rendering process with a function that would generate a ray of light that could intersect objects in the scene. We calculated the
                average irradiance of a single pixel, using a variable controlling the number of samples to take and random sampler to randomize the locations of
                each one. For each sampled pixel, we create a new ray and evaluate the radiance. The new camera ray was made using hFov and vFov, modifying them
                with a transform and normalization operation to get the ray’s direction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once the ray was generated and intersected with an object, we programmed the logic behind a ray-object intersection. For the triangle intersection,
                we used the Moller Trumbore algorithm, as taught in lecture, which gave us the t-value at which the ray hit the triangle. An intersection struct
                was then population with information based on the intersection, including a t-value and bsdf (obtained from the mesh). Similarly, sphere intersections
                were handled using the quadratic formula, barycentric coordinate mapping, intersection initialization. Spheres may have two t-values, and we used the
                closer one to populate the intersection data. In this part of the project, we used normal shading so that the objects would render without
                implementing the reflectance part.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below are images of simple geometries that we could render after completing this part.

            </div>


            <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>
                We then implemented a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) system to speed up the PathTracer so that we could render more complex geometries
                without excessive wait times. We first constructed a BVH by computing a bounding box and storing its centroid. We then traversed the boxes,
                using the mean of the centroids to determine the splitting point. This was followed by handling the case of a ray intersecting a BVH. As
                with the past intersections, there were two methods – one that would check for an intersection and one that would check for an intersection
                while also updating the data of the intersection passed into it. The BVH intersection function would call the triangle/sphere ones and
                recurse on its left and right children.
            </p>
            <p>
                After implementing this, we were able to render more complicated structures, as pictured below.
            </p>
            <div align="center">
                <table style="width=100%">

                            <figcaption align="middle">Lucy</figcaption>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>Here are some of the renderig times before and after BVH was implemented: </p>
            <ul>CBGems: ~15s with 1 thread, no BVH</ul>
            <ul>~0.4779s with 1 thread, with BVH</ul>
            <ul>Banana: ~2:15 with 1 thread, no BVH</ul>
            <ul>0.5229s with 1 thread, with bvh</ul>

            <p> There is a clear speedup after BVH was implemented. Even though the banana is quite a bit more complex than the gems, this difference is
            far more noticeable with no BVH, as rendering takes about 9x as long compared to just over 1x as long with BVH. </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
            <p>
                For the next part, we implemented two types of direct lighting functions: direct hemisphere lighting and direct lighting with importance
                sampling. For the first, we uniformly sampled around the hit, calculating the radiance from every ray intersecting a light source. This was
                simpler to do but produced a noisier, less smooth image.
            </p>

            <p>
                In direct lighting with importance sampling, we all account for all light sources. This was  done by using SceneLight and sampling the
                radiance from every light’s surface. The overall result was a smoother image, but with a slower rendering time. A comparison of the two
                outputs is shown here. Each set was taken at 1, 4, 16, and 64 light rays -- the first set was done with lighting sampling and the second
                with uniform hemisphere sampling.
            </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
            <p>
                The next step for more realistic rendering was implementing indirect lighting. Given that we had completed the case of what light should do
                when it bounced a single time, we implemented at_least_one_bounce_radiance, which used the one bounce case and a Russian roulette algorithm
                to determine if the ray should bounce again or not (with probably 0.35 that it should not). For greatest contrast between the two lighting 
                schemes, an image under direct (left) and indirect (right) illumination is shown below.

        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we implemented many computer rendering techniques learned in lecture. Seeing the effects of these algorithms
            on a live example was extremely rewarding and helped reinforce our learning.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

        <p>
            De Casteljau’s algorithm is used to evaluate polynomials from a set of points. The polynomial is used to define a
            Bezier curve. The way that it works is by taking two adjacent points and plotting a new point on that line that
            connects them at the given ratio. Then the algorithm recurses on the new points until one point is reached. There is
            also a ratio given to determine how far the new point should be between two existing points. Changing that value from
            0 to 1 forms a smooth curve.

        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
        <p>
            The algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by using it on one dimension at a time. In a 3D coordinate of points, de
            Casteljau algorithm is performed on each row using a given constant. Then will yield a 2D array. Then the algorithm
            is performed again on that singular array using another constant. The final result will be a single point.

        <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
        <p>
            For this part of the project, we iterated through all of the faces that included the given vertex. For each face, we obtained
            the normal, calculated the area of the face by taking the norm of the cross products of the vertices, and multiplied the
            normal by the area. This was then added to an ongoing sum of the total weighted areas, which was normalized after checking
            all the faces.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
        <p>
            As the instructions suggested, I drew out a simple case for an edge flip, with four vertices composing 2 faces. We began by
            labeling the vertices, edges, faces, and half-edges, both in the drawing and in the code. Then I drew out the edge flip, noted
            how the edges and faces would change, and modified the labels in the code accordingly.

                <tr>

                        <img src="images/proj2_pt4_before.png" align="middle" width="400px" />

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the edge flip, we drew out a diagram of the changes the mesh would go through, labeling all components. WE reused
            the labeling from part four and added in several new labels for the new vertex, edges, and face. Again, we followed my hand
            drawn diagram for how to update each part after the split.

        </div>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
        <p>
            To implement loop subdivision I closely followed the steps outlined in the starter code. First, I calculated future
            positions of the existing vertices and stored them in the vertices’ newPosition for future updates. Then I calculated
            the future positions of the existing edges. Third, I called splitEdge from the previous part to split every edge in
            the existing mesh. The new vertices are marked as new ones so that for the next step we can properly identify which
            edges need to be flipped. The condition for flipping the edge is having one end to connect to an old vertex and one
            end connect to a new vertex. Once that is done all the vertices old and new, are updated to their new position.
        </p>

        <p>
            To have the cube subdivide symmetrically, I flipped edges so that each vertex at the opposite corners of the cube have
            the same number of edges connected to it. That way once the edges are split it maintains symmetry in the 3D space. The
            important thing to note while flipping and splitting is that each face should have a similar area so that when it is
            subdivided further it reminds the same ratio as surrounding faces, this way a smoother image can be created.
        </p>
